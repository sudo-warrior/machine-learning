# 2.2.5.3.2.2.2.4.2.3.3.2.3 Cubic Saddle Comparison

## Comparing NAG and Momentum on Cubic Saddle Functions

In this section, we'll compare Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG) and standard momentum on cubic saddle functions. Cubic saddle functions are more complex than the basic quadratic saddle function and provide a more challenging test for optimization algorithms. They often have higher-order saddle points with more complex curvature properties.

## The Cubic Saddle Function

We'll focus on the monkey saddle function, which is a classic example of a cubic saddle function:

$$f(x, y) = x^3 - 3xy^2$$

This function has a saddle point at $(0, 0)$ with a function value of $0$. Unlike the basic saddle function, which has one direction of negative curvature and one direction of positive curvature, the monkey saddle has multiple directions of negative curvature, making it more challenging for optimization algorithms.

The gradient of this function is:

$$\nabla f(x, y) = \begin{bmatrix} 3x^2 - 3y^2 \\ -6xy \end{bmatrix}$$

Let's first visualize this function to understand its landscape:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D

# Define the monkey saddle function
def monkey_saddle(x, y):
    return x**3 - 3*x*y**2

# Define the gradient of the monkey saddle function
def grad_monkey_saddle(x, y):
    return np.array([3*x**2 - 3*y**2, -6*x*y])

# Create a 3D surface plot of the monkey saddle function
def plot_monkey_saddle_3d():
    # Create a grid of x and y values
    x = np.linspace(-2, 2, 100)
    y = np.linspace(-2, 2, 100)
    X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
    Z = monkey_saddle(X, Y)
    
    # Create a 3D surface plot
    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))
    ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')
    surf = ax.plot_surface(X, Y, Z, cmap='viridis', alpha=0.8, edgecolor='none')
    ax.set_xlabel('x')
    ax.set_ylabel('y')
    ax.set_zlabel('f(x, y)')
    ax.set_title('Monkey Saddle Function: f(x, y) = x³ - 3xy²')
    plt.show()

# Create a contour plot of the monkey saddle function
def plot_monkey_saddle_contour():
    # Create a grid of x and y values
    x = np.linspace(-2, 2, 100)
    y = np.linspace(-2, 2, 100)
    X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
    Z = monkey_saddle(X, Y)
    
    # Create a contour plot
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
    contour = plt.contour(X, Y, Z, 20, cmap='viridis')
    plt.colorbar(label='f(x, y) value')
    plt.plot(0, 0, 'ro', markersize=8, label='Saddle Point (0, 0)')
    plt.xlabel('x')
    plt.ylabel('y')
    plt.title('Contour Plot of Monkey Saddle Function')
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()

# Visualize the monkey saddle function
plot_monkey_saddle_3d()
plot_monkey_saddle_contour()
```

## Comparing Optimization Paths

Now, let's compare the optimization paths of standard gradient descent, gradient descent with momentum, and Nesterov Accelerated Gradient on the monkey saddle function. We'll start from different initial points near the saddle point to see how each algorithm behaves.

```python
# Import the optimization algorithms and visualization functions from the previous section
# (Assuming they are defined in a module called 'saddle_optimization')
from saddle_optimization import (
    gradient_descent_2d, momentum_2d, nag_2d,
    plot_optimization_paths, compute_distance_to_saddle,
    plot_distance_to_saddle, compute_function_values,
    plot_function_values, analyze_escape_behavior
)

# Define starting points near the saddle point
start_points = [
    (0.1, 0.1),   # Quadrant 1
    (-0.1, 0.1),  # Quadrant 2
    (-0.1, -0.1), # Quadrant 3
    (0.1, -0.1),  # Quadrant 4
    (0.2, 0),     # Positive x-axis
    (-0.2, 0),    # Negative x-axis
    (0, 0.2),     # Positive y-axis
    (0, -0.2)     # Negative y-axis
]

# Run the optimization algorithms and visualize the paths
paths_gd, paths_momentum, paths_nag = plot_optimization_paths(
    monkey_saddle, grad_monkey_saddle, 
    x_range=(-2, 2), y_range=(-2, 2),
    start_points=start_points,
    learning_rate=0.05, momentum=0.9, n_iterations=100,
    title='Optimization Paths on Monkey Saddle Function'
)
```

### Analysis of Optimization Paths

When comparing the optimization paths on the monkey saddle function, we observe several key differences:

1. **Gradient Descent**: Standard gradient descent struggles with the monkey saddle function due to its complex curvature properties. The paths often follow the directions of steepest descent, which can lead to inefficient trajectories and slow escape from the saddle point.

2. **Momentum**: Gradient descent with momentum shows improved performance compared to standard gradient descent. The accumulated momentum helps it maintain progress and escape the saddle point more efficiently. However, it may still exhibit oscillatory behavior in some regions.

3. **NAG**: Nesterov Accelerated Gradient demonstrates the most efficient escape from the saddle point. The "look-ahead" step allows it to anticipate changes in the gradient, resulting in smoother paths and faster escape. NAG is particularly effective at navigating the complex curvature of the monkey saddle.

Let's quantify these differences by analyzing the distance to the saddle point and the function values along the optimization paths:

```python
# Compute the distance to the saddle point for each iteration
distances_gd = compute_distance_to_saddle(paths_gd)
distances_momentum = compute_distance_to_saddle(paths_momentum)
distances_nag = compute_distance_to_saddle(paths_nag)

# Plot the distance to the saddle point vs. iteration
plot_distance_to_saddle(
    distances_gd, distances_momentum, distances_nag,
    title='Distance to Saddle Point vs. Iteration (Monkey Saddle)'
)

# Compute the function values along the optimization paths
values_gd = compute_function_values(paths_gd, monkey_saddle)
values_momentum = compute_function_values(paths_momentum, monkey_saddle)
values_nag = compute_function_values(paths_nag, monkey_saddle)

# Plot the function values vs. iteration
plot_function_values(
    values_gd, values_momentum, values_nag,
    title='Function Value vs. Iteration (Monkey Saddle)'
)

# Analyze the escape behavior from the saddle point
iterations_to_escape_gd, iterations_to_escape_momentum, iterations_to_escape_nag = analyze_escape_behavior(
    paths_gd, paths_momentum, paths_nag,
    threshold=0.5
)
```

### Analysis of Escape Behavior

The analysis of escape behavior reveals:

1. **Escape Speed**: NAG typically escapes the saddle point faster than standard momentum, which in turn escapes faster than standard gradient descent. This difference is even more pronounced on the monkey saddle function than on the basic saddle function, highlighting NAG's advantage on more complex saddle points.

2. **Escape Direction**: The monkey saddle has multiple directions of negative curvature, making the escape direction more complex. NAG and momentum are better at identifying and following efficient escape directions than standard gradient descent.

3. **Function Value Progression**: The function values along the paths show that NAG typically achieves more extreme function values (either more positive or more negative, depending on the escape direction) in fewer iterations than the other algorithms, indicating faster progress away from the saddle point.

4. **Stability**: NAG exhibits more stable behavior than standard momentum, with less oscillation and more consistent progress. This is particularly valuable on the monkey saddle function, where the complex curvature can cause instability in the optimization process.

## Effect of Learning Rate

The learning rate is a crucial hyperparameter for all three algorithms, especially on the more complex monkey saddle function. Let's analyze how different learning rates affect their performance:

```python
# Define learning rates to analyze
learning_rates = [0.01, 0.05, 0.1]

# Analyze the effect of learning rate
results_gd, results_momentum, results_nag = analyze_learning_rate_effect(
    monkey_saddle, grad_monkey_saddle,
    start_point=(0.1, 0.1),
    learning_rates=learning_rates,
    momentum=0.9, n_iterations=100,
    title='Effect of Learning Rate on Optimization Paths (Monkey Saddle)'
)
```

### Analysis of Learning Rate Effect

When comparing the effect of different learning rates on the three algorithms for the monkey saddle function, we observe:

1. **Low Learning Rate (0.01)**: All three algorithms make slow progress away from the saddle point. NAG shows a slight advantage in terms of escape speed, but the difference is not dramatic.

2. **Medium Learning Rate (0.05)**: This is often a good balance for all three algorithms on the monkey saddle function. NAG shows a more significant advantage in escape speed and directness of the path.

3. **High Learning Rate (0.1)**: With a high learning rate, standard gradient descent may become unstable and exhibit chaotic behavior on the monkey saddle function. Momentum can also become unstable, but NAG tends to maintain better control and stability even with higher learning rates.

4. **Sensitivity to Learning Rate**: NAG is generally less sensitive to the choice of learning rate than standard momentum or gradient descent on the monkey saddle function, making it more robust in practice. This is particularly valuable for complex saddle points where the optimal learning rate may be difficult to determine.

## Effect of Momentum Parameter

The momentum parameter $\gamma$ is another crucial hyperparameter for both momentum and NAG. Let's analyze how different momentum values affect their performance on the monkey saddle function:

```python
# Define momentum values to analyze
momentum_values = [0.5, 0.9, 0.99]

# Analyze the effect of momentum parameter
results_momentum, results_nag = analyze_momentum_effect(
    monkey_saddle, grad_monkey_saddle,
    start_point=(0.1, 0.1),
    momentum_values=momentum_values,
    learning_rate=0.05, n_iterations=100,
    title='Effect of Momentum Parameter on Optimization Paths (Monkey Saddle)'
)
```

### Analysis of Momentum Parameter Effect

When comparing the effect of different momentum values on both algorithms for the monkey saddle function, we observe:

1. **Low Momentum (0.5)**: Both algorithms show moderate improvement over standard gradient descent, with NAG having a slight edge in escape speed and stability.

2. **Medium Momentum (0.9)**: This is often a good balance for both algorithms on the monkey saddle function. NAG shows a more significant advantage in escape speed, directness of the path, and stability.

3. **High Momentum (0.99)**: With high momentum, both algorithms escape the saddle point very quickly, but standard momentum may exhibit more oscillation and instability. NAG's "look-ahead" approach helps it maintain better control even with high momentum, resulting in more stable and efficient optimization.

4. **Escape Direction**: Higher momentum values help both algorithms identify and follow efficient escape directions on the monkey saddle function, which has multiple directions of negative curvature. NAG is particularly effective at navigating these complex curvature properties.

## Another Cubic Saddle Function: The Cubic-Linear Saddle

Let's also examine another cubic saddle function, the cubic-linear saddle:

$$f(x, y) = x^3 + y$$

This function has a saddle point at $(0, 0)$ with a function value of $0$. It has a cubic behavior in the $x$ direction and a linear behavior in the $y$ direction, creating a different type of saddle point.

The gradient of this function is:

$$\nabla f(x, y) = \begin{bmatrix} 3x^2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$$

Let's visualize this function and compare the optimization algorithms on it:

```python
# Define the cubic-linear saddle function
def cubic_linear_saddle(x, y):
    return x**3 + y

# Define the gradient of the cubic-linear saddle function
def grad_cubic_linear_saddle(x, y):
    return np.array([3*x**2, 1])

# Create a 3D surface plot of the cubic-linear saddle function
def plot_cubic_linear_saddle_3d():
    # Create a grid of x and y values
    x = np.linspace(-2, 2, 100)
    y = np.linspace(-2, 2, 100)
    X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
    Z = cubic_linear_saddle(X, Y)
    
    # Create a 3D surface plot
    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))
    ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')
    surf = ax.plot_surface(X, Y, Z, cmap='viridis', alpha=0.8, edgecolor='none')
    ax.set_xlabel('x')
    ax.set_ylabel('y')
    ax.set_zlabel('f(x, y)')
    ax.set_title('Cubic-Linear Saddle Function: f(x, y) = x³ + y')
    plt.show()

# Create a contour plot of the cubic-linear saddle function
def plot_cubic_linear_saddle_contour():
    # Create a grid of x and y values
    x = np.linspace(-2, 2, 100)
    y = np.linspace(-2, 2, 100)
    X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
    Z = cubic_linear_saddle(X, Y)
    
    # Create a contour plot
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
    contour = plt.contour(X, Y, Z, 20, cmap='viridis')
    plt.colorbar(label='f(x, y) value')
    plt.plot(0, 0, 'ro', markersize=8, label='Saddle Point (0, 0)')
    plt.xlabel('x')
    plt.ylabel('y')
    plt.title('Contour Plot of Cubic-Linear Saddle Function')
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()

# Visualize the cubic-linear saddle function
plot_cubic_linear_saddle_3d()
plot_cubic_linear_saddle_contour()

# Define starting points near the saddle point
start_points = [
    (0.1, 0.1),   # Quadrant 1
    (-0.1, 0.1),  # Quadrant 2
    (-0.1, -0.1), # Quadrant 3
    (0.1, -0.1)   # Quadrant 4
]

# Run the optimization algorithms and visualize the paths
paths_gd, paths_momentum, paths_nag = plot_optimization_paths(
    cubic_linear_saddle, grad_cubic_linear_saddle, 
    x_range=(-2, 2), y_range=(-2, 2),
    start_points=start_points,
    learning_rate=0.05, momentum=0.9, n_iterations=100,
    title='Optimization Paths on Cubic-Linear Saddle Function'
)
```

### Analysis of Cubic-Linear Saddle Results

The cubic-linear saddle function presents a different challenge than the monkey saddle:

1. **Gradient Behavior**: The gradient in the $y$ direction is constant (always 1), while the gradient in the $x$ direction depends on $x^2$. This means that near the saddle point, the gradient in the $x$ direction is very small, making it challenging for optimization algorithms to make progress in this direction.

2. **Gradient Descent**: Standard gradient descent moves primarily in the $y$ direction (downward) due to the constant gradient, with very slow progress in the $x$ direction near the saddle point.

3. **Momentum**: Gradient descent with momentum also moves primarily in the $y$ direction initially, but the accumulated momentum eventually helps it make progress in the $x$ direction as well.

4. **NAG**: Nesterov Accelerated Gradient shows the most balanced progress in both the $x$ and $y$ directions. The "look-ahead" step allows it to better capture the curvature in the $x$ direction, resulting in more efficient optimization.

Let's quantify these differences by analyzing the distance to the saddle point and the function values along the optimization paths:

```python
# Compute the distance to the saddle point for each iteration
distances_gd = compute_distance_to_saddle(paths_gd)
distances_momentum = compute_distance_to_saddle(paths_momentum)
distances_nag = compute_distance_to_saddle(paths_nag)

# Plot the distance to the saddle point vs. iteration
plot_distance_to_saddle(
    distances_gd, distances_momentum, distances_nag,
    title='Distance to Saddle Point vs. Iteration (Cubic-Linear Saddle)'
)

# Compute the function values along the optimization paths
values_gd = compute_function_values(paths_gd, cubic_linear_saddle)
values_momentum = compute_function_values(paths_momentum, cubic_linear_saddle)
values_nag = compute_function_values(paths_nag, cubic_linear_saddle)

# Plot the function values vs. iteration
plot_function_values(
    values_gd, values_momentum, values_nag,
    title='Function Value vs. Iteration (Cubic-Linear Saddle)'
)

# Analyze the escape behavior from the saddle point
iterations_to_escape_gd, iterations_to_escape_momentum, iterations_to_escape_nag = analyze_escape_behavior(
    paths_gd, paths_momentum, paths_nag,
    threshold=0.5
)
```

## Summary

In this section, we've compared Nesterov Accelerated Gradient and standard momentum on cubic saddle functions:

1. **Monkey Saddle**: We've analyzed the behavior of the three algorithms on the monkey saddle function, which has multiple directions of negative curvature. NAG has shown superior performance in terms of escape speed, stability, and efficiency.

2. **Cubic-Linear Saddle**: We've examined another cubic saddle function with different curvature properties. NAG has demonstrated better balanced progress in both the $x$ and $y$ directions, highlighting its ability to capture complex curvature information.

3. **Effect of Hyperparameters**: We've investigated how different learning rates and momentum values affect the performance of the algorithms on cubic saddle functions. NAG has shown greater robustness to hyperparameter choices, making it more reliable in practice.

4. **Escape Behavior**: We've quantified the escape behavior of the three algorithms, confirming that NAG typically escapes cubic saddle points faster and more efficiently than standard momentum or gradient descent.

The results on cubic saddle functions reinforce the advantages of NAG over standard momentum for escaping saddle points, especially for more complex saddle points with higher-order curvature properties. NAG's "look-ahead" approach allows it to better capture and utilize curvature information, resulting in more efficient optimization.

In the next section, we'll analyze the results of our comparisons on simple saddle functions and draw conclusions about the relative performance of NAG and standard momentum on saddle points.
