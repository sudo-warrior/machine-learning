# 2.3.4.5 Probabilistic Graphical Models

## Understanding Probabilistic Graphical Models

Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) are a powerful framework for representing and reasoning with complex probability distributions. They combine graph theory and probability theory to provide a compact and intuitive representation of the dependencies among random variables. PGMs have become essential tools in machine learning, enabling efficient inference, learning, and decision-making in domains with uncertainty. In this section, we'll explore the fundamentals of probabilistic graphical models, their types, and their applications in machine learning.

## Motivation and Basic Concepts

### The Challenge of High-Dimensional Distributions

Representing and computing with joint probability distributions becomes challenging as the number of variables increases:

- **Representation Size**: A joint distribution over n binary variables requires 2^n - 1 parameters
- **Computational Complexity**: Operations like marginalization and conditioning become exponentially expensive
- **Data Sparsity**: Estimating all parameters accurately requires exponentially more data

### Graphical Models as a Solution

Probabilistic graphical models address these challenges by:

- **Exploiting Independence**: Representing only the direct dependencies between variables
- **Factorizing Distributions**: Decomposing joint distributions into smaller factors
- **Enabling Efficient Algorithms**: Supporting specialized inference and learning algorithms

### Graph Representation

In a graphical model:

- **Nodes**: Represent random variables
- **Edges**: Represent direct probabilistic relationships between variables
- **Absence of Edges**: Indicates conditional independence relationships

### Types of Graphical Models

The two main types of graphical models are:

1. **Directed Graphical Models (Bayesian Networks)**:
   - Represent distributions using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)
   - Edges indicate direct causal or influential relationships
   - Factorize joint distribution as product of conditional probabilities

2. **Undirected Graphical Models (Markov Random Fields)**:
   - Represent distributions using undirected graphs
   - Edges indicate mutual dependencies without directionality
   - Factorize joint distribution as product of potential functions

## Directed Graphical Models (Bayesian Networks)

### Structure and Semantics

A **Bayesian Network** is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where:

- Each node represents a random variable X_i
- Each edge X_i → X_j represents a direct dependency of X_j on X_i
- Each node X_i is associated with a conditional probability distribution P(X_i | Parents(X_i))

### Factorization

The joint distribution factorizes according to the graph structure:

$$P(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n) = \prod_{i=1}^n P(X_i | \text{Parents}(X_i))$$

This factorization can lead to an exponential reduction in the number of parameters needed to specify the distribution.

### Conditional Independence

In a Bayesian network, a node is conditionally independent of its non-descendants given its parents. More generally, conditional independence relationships can be read from the graph using the concept of **d-separation**:

Variables X and Y are d-separated by Z if all paths between X and Y are blocked by Z, where a path is blocked if it contains:
- A chain A → B → C where B is in Z
- A fork A ← B → C where B is in Z
- A collider A → B ← C where neither B nor any of its descendants are in Z

### Example: Student Bayesian Network

Consider a simple Bayesian network for modeling student performance:

```
    Difficulty
    ↙       ↘
Intelligence   Grade
    ↘       ↗
     SAT
```

This network encodes the following factorization:

$$P(D, I, G, S) = P(D) \cdot P(I) \cdot P(G|D,I) \cdot P(S|I)$$

where:
- D: Difficulty of the course
- I: Intelligence of the student
- G: Grade in the course
- S: SAT score

### Representation of Conditional Probabilities

Conditional probabilities in Bayesian networks can be represented as:

1. **Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs)**: For discrete variables
2. **Conditional Probability Distributions (CPDs)**: For continuous variables
3. **Parameterized Functions**: Such as logistic regression or neural networks

### Learning Bayesian Networks

Learning a Bayesian network involves:

1. **Structure Learning**: Determining the graph structure
   - Constraint-based methods: Test conditional independence relationships
   - Score-based methods: Search for structures that maximize a score function
   - Hybrid methods: Combine both approaches

2. **Parameter Learning**: Estimating the conditional probabilities
   - Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
   - Bayesian estimation with prior distributions
   - Expectation-Maximization (EM) for incomplete data

### Inference in Bayesian Networks

Common inference tasks include:

1. **Marginal Inference**: Computing P(X) for some variables X
2. **Conditional Inference**: Computing P(X|E=e) for query variables X given evidence E=e
3. **MAP Inference**: Finding the most likely assignment to variables X given evidence

Inference algorithms include:

1. **Exact Inference**:
   - Variable elimination
   - Junction tree algorithm
   - Belief propagation (for trees)

2. **Approximate Inference**:
   - Sampling methods (e.g., Gibbs sampling, importance sampling)
   - Variational inference
   - Loopy belief propagation

## Undirected Graphical Models (Markov Random Fields)

### Structure and Semantics

A **Markov Random Field (MRF)** is an undirected graph where:

- Each node represents a random variable X_i
- Each edge {X_i, X_j} represents a direct dependency between X_i and X_j
- The joint distribution is defined in terms of potential functions over cliques

### Factorization

The joint distribution factorizes according to the maximal cliques in the graph:

$$P(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n) = \frac{1}{Z} \prod_{c \in \mathcal{C}} \phi_c(X_c)$$

where:
- $\mathcal{C}$ is the set of maximal cliques in the graph
- $\phi_c(X_c)$ is a non-negative potential function over the variables in clique c
- Z is a normalization constant (partition function): $Z = \sum_x \prod_{c \in \mathcal{C}} \phi_c(X_c)$

### Conditional Independence

In an MRF, the **Markov property** states that a variable is conditionally independent of all other variables given its neighbors:

$$P(X_i | X_{-i}) = P(X_i | \text{Neighbors}(X_i))$$

More generally, variables X and Y are conditionally independent given Z if all paths between X and Y pass through Z.

### Example: Image Modeling MRF

In image modeling, a common MRF structure is a grid where:

- Each node represents a pixel
- Edges connect neighboring pixels
- Potential functions encourage similar values for neighboring pixels

```
    X₁₁ --- X₁₂ --- X₁₃
     |       |       |
    X₂₁ --- X₂₂ --- X₂₃
     |       |       |
    X₃₁ --- X₃₂ --- X₃₃
```

### Potential Functions

Potential functions in MRFs can take various forms:

1. **Indicator Potentials**: $\phi_c(X_c) \in \{0, 1\}$
2. **Exponential Family Potentials**: $\phi_c(X_c) = \exp(f_c(X_c))$
3. **Log-Linear Models**: $\phi_c(X_c) = \exp(\sum_k \theta_k f_k(X_c))$

### Pairwise Markov Random Fields

A common special case is the **pairwise MRF**, where potentials are defined only over pairs of variables:

$$P(X) = \frac{1}{Z} \prod_{i} \phi_i(X_i) \prod_{(i,j) \in E} \phi_{ij}(X_i, X_j)$$

where E is the set of edges in the graph.

### Learning Markov Random Fields

Learning an MRF involves:

1. **Structure Learning**: Determining the graph structure
   - Often based on domain knowledge or predefined structures
   - Can use similar approaches as for Bayesian networks

2. **Parameter Learning**: Estimating the parameters of the potential functions
   - Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
   - Pseudo-likelihood methods
   - Contrastive divergence

The main challenge in learning MRFs is computing the partition function Z, which is often intractable.

### Inference in Markov Random Fields

Inference tasks and algorithms are similar to those for Bayesian networks, with some adaptations for the undirected nature of the model.

## Factor Graphs

### Motivation and Definition

**Factor graphs** provide a unified representation for both directed and undirected graphical models. They explicitly represent the factorization of the distribution.

A factor graph is a bipartite graph with:
- Variable nodes representing random variables
- Factor nodes representing factors or potential functions
- Edges connecting variables to the factors they participate in

### Factorization

The joint distribution in a factor graph is:

$$P(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n) = \frac{1}{Z} \prod_{j=1}^m f_j(X_{S_j})$$

where:
- $f_j$ is the j-th factor
- $X_{S_j}$ is the subset of variables connected to factor j
- Z is a normalization constant (if needed)

### Example: Factor Graph Representation

Consider the student Bayesian network from earlier. Its factor graph representation is:

```
    D       I
    |       |
    f₁      f₂
    |       |
    |       |
    +---f₃--+
    |       |
    G       S
            |
            f₄
```

where:
- f₁(D) = P(D)
- f₂(I) = P(I)
- f₃(D,I,G) = P(G|D,I)
- f₄(I,S) = P(S|I)

### Inference in Factor Graphs

Factor graphs support efficient inference algorithms, particularly:

- **Belief Propagation**: Passes messages between variable and factor nodes
- **Sum-Product Algorithm**: Computes marginal distributions
- **Max-Product Algorithm**: Computes MAP assignments

## Specialized Graphical Models

### Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)

**Hidden Markov Models** are directed graphical models for sequential data:

```
    X₁ → X₂ → X₃ → ... → Xₙ
    ↓    ↓    ↓         ↓
    Y₁   Y₂   Y₃        Yₙ
```

where:
- X_t are hidden states
- Y_t are observations
- The model assumes the Markov property: P(X_t|X_{1:t-1}) = P(X_t|X_{t-1})

HMMs support efficient algorithms for:
- **Filtering**: Computing P(X_t|Y_{1:t})
- **Smoothing**: Computing P(X_t|Y_{1:T}) for t < T
- **Prediction**: Computing P(X_{t+k}|Y_{1:t}) for k > 0
- **Most likely sequence**: Finding the most likely state sequence (Viterbi algorithm)

### Conditional Random Fields (CRFs)

**Conditional Random Fields** are discriminative models that directly model the conditional distribution P(Y|X):

$$P(Y|X) = \frac{1}{Z(X)} \prod_{c \in \mathcal{C}} \phi_c(Y_c, X)$$

CRFs are particularly useful for structured prediction tasks like sequence labeling.

### Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs)

**Restricted Boltzmann Machines** are undirected graphical models with:
- A layer of visible units v
- A layer of hidden units h
- No connections within each layer

The joint distribution is:

$$P(v, h) = \frac{1}{Z} \exp(-E(v, h))$$

where E(v, h) is an energy function.

RBMs can be stacked to form Deep Belief Networks.

### Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

**Latent Dirichlet Allocation** is a directed graphical model for topic modeling:

```
    α → θ → z → w ← β
        |    |
        V    N
        |    |
        D    
```

where:
- θ are document-topic distributions
- z are topic assignments
- w are observed words
- α and β are hyperparameters
